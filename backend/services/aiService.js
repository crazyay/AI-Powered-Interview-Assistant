QUESTION: ${question}
EXPECTED ANSWER: ${expectedAnswer}
CANDIDATE ANSWER: ${answer}

SCORING RULES (BE VERY STRICT):
- 0-20: Wrong, irrelevant, or shows no understanding
- 21-40: Partially correct but missing key concepts or has major errors  
- 41-60: Generally correct but incomplete or lacks depth
- 61-80: Good answer covering most key points with minor gaps
- 81-100: Excellent, complete, accurate answer with good understanding

CRITICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. Technical Accuracy (40%): Are the technical facts correct?
2. Completeness (30%): Does it address all parts of the question?
3. Understanding (20%): Shows deep conceptual understanding?
4. Clarity (10%): Is the explanation clear and well-structured?

BE HARSH - Most answers should score 40-70. Only exceptional answers deserve 80+.
Empty or vague answers should score 0-20.

Return ONLY the numeric score (0-100), nothing else.`;
